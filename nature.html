	<p>Nature is an important and integral part of mankind. <b><i>It is one of the greatest blessings for human life</b></i>; however, nowadays humans fail to recognize
	 it as one. Nature has been an inspiration for numerous poets, writers, artists and more of yesteryears. This remarkable creation inspired them to write poems 
	and stories in the glory of it. 
	
	<p>They truly valued nature which reflects in their works even today. Essentially, nature is everything we are surrounded by like the water we drink, the air we 
	breathe, the sun we soak in, sthe birds we hear chirping, the moon we gaze at and more. Above all, it is rich and vibrant and consists of both living and non-living things. 
	Therefore, people of the modern age should also learn something from people of yesteryear and start valuing nature before it gets too late.

	<li>The importance of nature</li></font>
	<br>Nature has come into existence long before human beings and since then it has taken care of mankind and nurtured it forever. In other words, it provides us with a 
	protective layer that protects us from all kinds of harms and harms. Without nature the survival of mankind is impossible and human beings need to understand this.

	<p>If nature has the power to protect us, it is also powerful enough to destroy all of humanity. Every form of nature, for example, plants, animals, rivers, mountains, 
	moons and more are equally important to us. The absence of one element is enough to wreak havoc on the work of human life.</font>
